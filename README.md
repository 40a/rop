### Minimal Railway Oriented Programming for Go

For reading more about on Railway Oriented Programming, look  [here](http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/).

For a sample see the test file. I've been tempted to create some async interfaces and the like, but what was doing actually, was abstracting Go syntax, which provides all sort of tools to make things concurrent.

It's easy to construct reusable chains and even (to some extent) graphs of functionalities.

Status: I've used it in bunch of in-house code bases & 'am happy with it. Of-course one coucld with full blown enterprisy frameworks! But I like how Go simplifies things to the bone!
